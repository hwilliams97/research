											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at Arizona State University. My research focuses on observations of high redshift sources that are magnified by galaxy-cluster scale gravitational lensing. I received my PhD from the University of Minnesota in 2025, where I worked with Professor Patrick Kelly.</p>

										<h2> Highly Magnified Massive Stars</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>Without the aid of gravitational lensing, individual stars can only be resolved in our closest neighbor galaxies (<40 Mpc). Massive stars in strongly-lensed galaxies at cosmological distances can be <i>individually</i> resolved and detected during caustic-crossing transient events, where the magnification of a star in a background galaxy lying close to the cluster's critical curve is temporarily greatly boosted by microlensing. Pre-JWST, a handful of these events had been detected in lensed galaxies at <i>z</i> ≈ 1 (e.g., Kelly+2018, Rodney+2018, Chen+2019). JWST's infrared sensitivity has dramatically improved our ability to detect these events, and dozens of magnified stars have now been detected in caustic crossing galaxies (Yan+2023, Fudamoto+2024, Williams+2026). Highly magnified individual stars have a wide range of science applications, including measuring the distribution of dark matter subhaloes, constraining the high-redshift stellar initial mass function, and potentially discriminating between dark matter models.</p>
	
									<p>My work focuses on characterizing the properties of massive stars and their host galaxies at <i>z</i> ≈ 1. I created a Bayesian inference program to fit lensed stars' SEDs with stellar atmosphere models, constraining the magnitudes, temperatures, surface gravities, and line-of-sight dust extinction. I applied this analysis to nine highly magnified stars that were identified in a single galaxy - the Warhol Arc (<i>z</i> = 0.94). These nine stars were discovered as transient sources in four epochs of JWST imaging of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416. I found that all nine transient sources have temperatures and minimum luminosities consistent with red supergiants. One of the transients was best-fit by a binary stellar model consisting of a red supergiant and a hot, B-type companion star.</p>

										<h2>An extremely compact and highly star-forming galaxy at <i>z</i> = 9.51</h2>
									</header>
							
									<p> 
										<img src="images/rxj2129.jpg" alt="color image of RX J2129" style="float:right" width="500">
										In 2022, I was a Co-I on a JWST director's discretionary time program (DD 2767; PI Kelly) which obtained NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of the RX J2129 galaxy cluster field. A triply-imaged galaxy at <i>z</i> = 9.51 (known as RXJ2129-z95) with strong nebular emission lines was found in the JWST data. The high magnification of the brightest image enabled detailed analysis of this intrinsically faint and low-mass galaxy that existed during the epoch of reionization when the Universe was 510 Myr old.
										I led the analysis of RXJ2129-z95 and found that the galaxy is extremely compact; <b>the effective radius is just 16.4 pc.</b>
										<br>
										<br>
										If RXJ2129-z95 is a star-forming galaxy, its strong nebular emission could represent a not yet understood mode of star formation: the Hβ flux would imply a star-formation rate of 1.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, resulting in an extremely high star formation rate surface density (1000  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> kpc<sup>-1</sup>) that is 30 larger than that typically observed at <i>z</i> = 6 - 8.
										The galaxy's stellar mass surface density of 2.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>&odot;</sub> kpc<sup>-2</sup> is on par with that observed in lensed star-forming clumps at high redshifts, suggesting that RXJ2129-z95 may be an isolated star-forming clump or an early progenitor of a globular cluster. 
										If instead the galaxy's emission is powered by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), RXJ2129-z95 would be the faintest, lowest-mass, and by far the most compact AGN ever discovered above redshift 8. 
										<br>
											<br>
									In either case, RXJ2129-z95 is an intriguing source that can be used to help address a wide range of science questions. My analysis of the galaxy was published in <i>Science</i> and has received over 100 citations. RXJ2129-z95 has been used to constrain an empirical model of reionization and the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation. The galaxy has been followed-up with JWST observations in two programs (GO 2957; PI Uebler, GO 6073; PI Citro).
